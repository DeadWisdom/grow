# grow

A platform for creating highly operational, continuously deployed services by defining a network of data-processing actors.

We shift focus from coding in editors to iteratively developing usable services. At the beginning, simple running processes can be defined, deployed, and interacted with. These can then be composed into larger workflows, and then deployed as fully-featured services. All along the way, everything is tested, monitored, and integrated, so there is no point where we can get ourselves in a situation that our service is un-deployable, un-integratable, or un-maintainable.

Code is no longer the hard part. LLMs give us an opportunity to let go of the code as the central focus. It never should have been anyway, because that makes us focus on solutions and implementations rather than needs and problems. This has always created a cart-before-the-horse mentality in the industry that drags it down. Philiosophies like Agile and Test Driven Development have tried to alieviate this, but developers are fundementally pushed towards thinking about the code first.

With Grow, developers define the fundemental structure like tests and reqiurements first. LLMs can then help us generate the code, and we can use our structure to validate and complete that work. We can also use the AI to modify or optimize the code. For instance, quickly updating code because an third-party API changed or automatically converting code from Python to Rust for optimization purposes.

Still we don't want to let go of everything all at once; we an still use grow with github and hand-generated code, but that takes a back-seat to the more difficult problems.
